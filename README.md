Well, Trey Pierce... he rocks. He rocks so hard we wanted to make him a website. So here it is. Rock on, Trey.

## Contributing
If you want to help us show how much trey rocks, we'd love to see what you have. Make a branch and open a pull request. The website itself is powered by GitHub Pages and runs the content from the `gh-pages` branch (as usual). I don't expect anyone to read or care bout this, it was mainly aimed at Rex cause Rex + Git = lol.
